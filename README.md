This Jupyter Notebook explores various Queue and Priority Queue implementations in Python. It uses collections.deque for FIFO queues (like a Bank Queue) and heapq for priority-based serving (like a Mixed Service Desk). The code demonstrates how to handle standard, numerical, sign-based, and hybrid priority queuing scenarios.
